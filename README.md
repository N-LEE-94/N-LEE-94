## Hi there, I'm Nathan.

<p>I'm a junior developer looking for my first role in tech. 
I have a degree in English Literature and taught for a few years. I made the leap into the world of software development when I undertook an intense 16 week bootcamp at the School of Code (https://schoolofcode.com/), and gained a thorough foundation of skills that have allowed me to work effectively in a development team. Myself and five others recently developed an app in just four weeks! You can check it out here: https://seasonalfood.netlify.app </p>
