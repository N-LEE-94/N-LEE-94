Hi there, I'm Nathan.

I'm a junior developer looking for my first role in tech. 
I have a degree in English Literature and taught for a few years. Thanks to an intense 16 week bootcamp at the School of Code (https://schoolofcode.com/), I've gained a foundation of skills that have allowed me to work effectively in a development team. Myself and five others recently developed an app in just four weeks! You can check it out here:
